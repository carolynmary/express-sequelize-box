POLLIFE, with a simple, user friendly interface, allows the user to quickly and easily create a poll, allow others to vote in their poll, and then to see the results.

## Installation

## Built With
Node & Express server
Handlebars
MySQL
Sequelize
CanvasJS (for chart visualization)

## Further Development
Future development features will include but are not limited to:

- Additional poll options which will allow the user to create a poll using a rating system, a request for input, or a sliding scale. 
- Users will be able to signup and login to keep track of polls and results. 
- Users will be able to generate a shareable link of their poll to give to friends to vote. 
- Users will be able to make ‘public’ polls for the whole world to contribute an opinion, which will appear on the public app interface (think Venmo), or ‘private’ for close friends, which will only appear between specified users or with those who have the link.
